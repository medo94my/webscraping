Python - Output Variables
=========================


Output Variables
----------------


The Python `print` statement is often used to output variables.


To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the 
`+` character:



### Example



```python
x = "awesome"print("Python is " + x)

```


You can also use the `+` character to add a variable to another variable:



### Example



```python
x = "Python is "y = "awesome"z =Â  x + y
print(z)

```


For numbers, the `+` character works as a mathematical operator:



### Example



```python
x = 5y = 10print(x + y)

```


If you try to combine a string and a number, Python will give you an error:



### Example



```python
x = 5y = "John"print(x + y)

```
