Python Tuple Methods
====================


Python has two built-in methods that you can use on tuples.




| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [count()](ref_tuple_count.asp) | Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple |
| [index()](ref_tuple_index.asp) | Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found |
