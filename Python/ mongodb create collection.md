Python MongoDB Create Collection
================================



A **collection** in MongoDB is the same as a **table** in SQL databases.



Creating a Collection
---------------------


To create a collection in MongoDB, use database object and specify the name 
of the collection you want to create.


MongoDB will create the collection if it does not exist.



### Example


Create a collection called "customers":



```python
import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
  mydb = myclient["mydatabase"]mycol = mydb["customers"]
```



**Important:** In MongoDB, a collection is not created until it 
 gets content!



MongoDB waits until you have inserted a document before it actually creates the collection.


Check if Collection Exists
--------------------------



**Remember:** In MongoDB, a collection is not created until it 
 gets content, so if this is your first time creating a collection, you should 
 complete the next chapter (create document) before 
 you check if the collection exists!



You can check if a collection exist in a database by listing all collections:



### Example


Return a list of all collections in your database:



```python
print(mydb.list\_collection\_names())
```


Or you can check a specific collection by name:



### Example


Check if the "customers" collection exists:



```python
collist = mydb.list\_collection\_names()if "customers" in collist:Â  
  print("The collection exists.")
```
