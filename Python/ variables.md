Python Variables
================


Variables
---------


Variables are containers for storing data values.


Creating Variables
------------------


Python has no command for declaring a variable.


A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.



### Example



```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

```


Variables do not need to be declared with any particular *type*, and can even change type after they have been set.



### Example



```python
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)

```


Casting
-------


If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.



### Example



```python
x = 
  str(3)    # x will be '3'y = int(3)    # y 
  will be 3z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
```
